# How to Play Simon Says Game

Simon Says is a classic memory game where players must follow a sequence of colors and sounds. The game will test and improve your memory as you progress through increasing levels of difficulty. Here’s how to play:

## Game Objective

Repeat the sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game. Each round, a new color is added to the sequence. Try to remember and replicate the sequence as long as possible.

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game**:
   - Press any key on your keyboard to start the game. The game will begin at Level 1.

2. **Game Sequence**:
   - The game will flash a color on one of the buttons.
   - The current level and sequence length will be displayed at the top of the screen.

3. **Player's Turn**:
   - After the game has shown the sequence, it’s your turn to repeat it.
   - Click on the buttons in the same order as the sequence shown by the game.
   - Each button click will light up the button and play a sound.

4. **Game Over**:
   - If you click the wrong button or fail to follow the sequence correctly, the game will end.
   - A "Game Over" message will appear, and you can restart the game by pressing any key.

## Tips for Success

- **Focus and Concentration**: Pay close attention to the sequence shown by the game. Try to minimize distractions while playing.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Look for patterns in the sequences to help you remember longer sequences more easily.
- **Practice**: The more you play, the better your memory will become. Keep practicing to improve your skills.
- **Pace Yourself**: Take your time when repeating the sequence. There’s no need to rush your inputs.

## Game Controls

- **Start/Restart the Game**: Press any key on your keyboard.
- **Repeat the Sequence**: Click on the colored buttons with your mouse.

## Visual Feedback

- Each button press will light up the button:
  - **Red**
  - **Blue**
  - **Green**
  - **Yellow**

## Example

1. **Level 1**: The game shows Red.
   - You click Red.

2. **Level 2**: The game shows Red, Blue.
   - You click Red, then Blue.

3. **Level 3**: The game shows Red, Blue, Green.
   - You click Red, Blue, then Green.

And so on. Each level adds one more color to the sequence you must remember and repeat.
