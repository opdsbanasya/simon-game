# Simon Says Game

- I used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to build this project.

## Project Overview

- The Simon Says game is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game. This project demonstrates my ability to create interactive web applications using fundamental web technologies.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure and layout of the game interface.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the game elements, including animations and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, including sequence generation, user input handling, and game progression.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players interact with the game by clicking on colored buttons, following the sequence generated by the game.
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons light up to indicate the sequence and player actions, providing clear visual feedback.

### Learning Experience

Creating the Simon Says game helped me deepen my understanding of:

- **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions through event listeners in JavaScript.
- **Game Logic Implementation**: Developing the logic to generate random sequences, track player progress, and determine game states.
- **CSS Animations**: Applying CSS transitions and animations to create a visually appealing and engaging user experience.
